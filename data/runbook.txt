How to prepare catalog

Select catalog from products:
q -H -O -d , "SELECT code, img_small_url AS image, name, (CAST((CAST(rrp AS REAL) * 100) AS INT)) AS price, sub_cat_name AS cat FROM product.csv WHERE cat IN (SELECT * FROM sub_cat_selection.csv) AND rrp NOT NULL" > catalog.csv

Clean product names:
clean_names.py

Remove duplicates based on product names:
awk -F ',' '!seen[$3]++' catalog.csv
