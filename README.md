- Scrap all sub categories of categories of products on booker website
- scarp each individual product page and get detailed information
- Store scraped data in database - Excel not cutting it
- Make Node or Python API to backwards engineer Booker scanner.
- script crashes when accessing index of un found element on page.
- use common login module / maybe merge scripts maybe not
- nutrition information bit complicated in a table maybe stringify html?
- remove rubbish from data if any more
